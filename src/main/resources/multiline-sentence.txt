Slope field is also called a direction field. The solutions of a first-order differential equation of a scalar
function y(x) can be drawn in a 2-dimensional space with the x in horizontal and y in vertical direction.
Possible solutions are functions y(x) drawn as solid curves. Sometimes it is too cumbersome solving the
differential equation analytically. Then one can still draw the tangents of the function curves e.g.
on a regular grid. The tangents are touching the functions at the grid points. However, the direction
field is rather agnostic about chaotic aspects of the differential equation.

Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher.
From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, "natural philosophy" encompassed
astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural
Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics.
